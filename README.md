# ckanext-highlight-related-items
Surface a dataset's related items more visibly. Normally, a dataset page
provides a text description of the dataset and then a bunch of "resources" in
various formats. For very technical users, this is perfect. For everyone else,
visualizations and applications are far more approachable. But they're buried in
the "Related" tab. This plugin simply surfaces those items above the "resources."

## Installation
I'm new to CKAN plugins, so I'm not 100% sure how to install them yet, but I'm
fairly certain you should be able to do something [like
this](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-disqus#activating-and-installing).
